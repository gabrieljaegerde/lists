## Exercises

1. **Generate Numbers**: Implement a function `generate_numbers` that returns a list of numbers from 1 to n.
2. **Merge and Sort Lists**: Implement a function `merge_and_sort_lists` that takes two lists as arguments, merges them into one list, and then sorts the merged list in ascending order.
3. **Remove Duplicates**: Implement a function `remove_duplicates` that removes all duplicate values in a list and returns a list with only the unique elements in the order they appeared.
4. **Is Sublist**: Implement a function `is_sublist` that checks whether a list is a sublist of another list. A sublist is a sequence of consecutive elements that are part of another list.
5. **Rotate List**: Implement a function `rotate_list` that rotates the elements of a list to the right by `k` places where `k` is non-negative.

Good luck and happy coding!
